# possum-wm [![Build Status][build-status-link]][build-status-img]

Possum is a keyboard-driven window manager for PalmPC-type devices.
(E.g., the Cosmo Communicator, whenever it gains the ability to run
Linux.)

Issue tracker: https://github.com/duckinator/possum-wm/issues

Planned features for the first version (if checked, it's been implemented):

- [ ] Android-style status bar at the top (time, wifi/mobile data/battery
  status)
- [ ] Apps are always full-screen/maximized.
- [ ] Tapping alt will bring up a dock. (Similarly to Android on the
  Cosmo Communicator.)
  - Assuming the dock will be a separate executable that Possum calls,
    this is about half implemented.
- [x] Alt+left/right arrow keys to switch windows.
- [ ] A configurable equivalent of Android's home button, to open or switch
  to a specific app.
